# 3D BoilerplateThe code here just shows a 3D spinning cube in your web-browser.This repo is meant to be used to start small 3D projects with strong workflow / architecture.## Global dependencies### NodeYou need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) environment to use this project.We will now install global node packages. Don't forget to sudo if you are on Unix / Mac.### GruntWe use the [grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) task runner to compile our sources and clean the workflow.After node is installed on your computer, you can install grunt as a globally available package with :```npm install -g gruntnpm install -g grunt-cli```### TypescriptThe source code is in [Typescript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/). This will provide us strong auto-completion in most IDE, and a lot of static error checking.Most widely used javascript libraries have [typescript definitions](http://definitelytyped.org/) available to get auto-completion and error checking.Don't forget to update them from time to time.To install the compiler and it's definition manager globally :```npm install -g typescriptnpm install -g tsd```### BowerWe use [bower](http://bower.io/) as javascript dependency manager. Most of javascript libraries are available.```npm install -g bower```## Project dependenciesUnix / Mac users, in most cases you need to `exit` your sudo session.### Grunt dependenciesTo install local grunt dependencies, call the following command in the `build/` folder.```npm install```### Typescript definitionsTo install used typescript definitions, call this in the `build/ folder :```tsd query waa --action installtsd query mediastream --action installtsd query three --action installtsd query greensock --action install```We use [three.js](http://threejs.org/) framework to abstract our 3D scenes and display them with WebGL.(waa and mediastream are webgl sub-dependencies).We also use the tween engine [gsap](http://greensock.com/gsap) from greensock for animations.### BowerWe use [bower](http://bower.io/) to install our dependencies. They are installed in the `lib/` folder.To install bower dependencies, call this in the `build/ folder :```bower install```### Run the projectTo run the project, use this command in the `build/` folder :This command will compile typescript sources + concat them in one file. When done this will launch a web-server (from the `deploy/` folder) and watch changed files to re-run the compiling and reload the browser if needed.```grunt```If you just need compiling (no watching, no server) :```grunt dev```Or if you need production compiling (with sources obfuscation) :```grunt dist```### That's it! Have fun :)
